# Continuation state

This file records recovery information for a fresh development session. Update
it at every milestone rather than relying on conversation history.

## Verified checkpoints

Commit `bfe1471` contains the native LaTeX prototype and the first Excalidraw
graphical builder. It was pushed to `main` after native PDF generation, strict
TypeScript/lint/unit checks, browser smoke interactions, and `npm audit` passed.

Commit `255ac74` completes the prose slice: styled text, semantic hyperlinks,
inline structured math editing, and direct syntax-coloured listing editing.

## Current verified slice

The canonical-transport slice adds:

- schema-versioned `.dans.json` whole-document persistence;
- plugin-owned block and inline codecs in the browser;
- stable document metadata and transactional full-document replacement;
- unknown block and inline payload preservation;
- Save/Load controls and a browser smoke import path;
- a strict native ordered-JSON and canonical-envelope implementation;
- one shared fixture that normalizes exactly in both implementations.

The native transport currently preserves plugin payloads opaquely. Native
plugin-specific materialization into runtime `DocumentBlock` instances is not
yet implemented; this is deliberately a separate adapter concern.

## Verification commands

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-clang -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build-clang --parallel
ctest --test-dir build-clang --output-on-failure

cd builder
npm run check
npm run smoke
npm audit --audit-level=low
```

The production build currently emits an expected large-chunk warning because
Excalidraw is bundled eagerly. This is not a correctness failure; adapter
isolation and lazy loading are the intended remedies.

## Next work

Add semantic title, ToC, page-break and section blocks next, then implement
continuous/paged builder layout. Keep plugin payload codecs beside their plugin
and extend the shared fixture whenever a new canonical type is completed.
